                    <h3>ROBERT OPPENHEIMER</h3>
                    <p>The Bonn-Oppenheimer Equation is on of the most profound equations in physics.</p>
                    <p>This 1936 image shows Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
                    <p>Faintly, in the background, we can see that he has begun work on his stunning equation.</p>

                    <h3>THE REAL OPPENHEIMER</h3>
                    <p>Contrary to Hollywood legend, working physicists did not conduct research in three-piece suits.</p>
                    <p>Oppenheimer's trademark brown suit, bespoke hat and, jaunty pipe were calculated to boost his public image.</p>
                    <p>This authentic document reminds us that behind the scenes, there was a grittier reality to the daily grind.</p>
                    <p>We, of course, know this is Oppenheimer because of his well-known affection for the color brown.</p>
